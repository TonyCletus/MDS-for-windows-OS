# Malaria-Diagnosing-System-VB.NET

PROJECT. SINCE VB.NET IS MORE OF WINDOWS BASED OS, THIS SOFTWARE WHEN COMPILED CAN RUN ON ALL WINDOWS.


THE MDS IS DESIGNED USING VB.NET.
USING THE CORE SYMPTOMS OF MALARIA TO CHECK IF A PATIENT IS HAVING MALARIA OR NOT.
MDS WORKS BASE ON THE USER INPUTS. MDS ALSO PRESCRIBES SOME DRUGS AND RENDER ADVICES BASE ON THE USER INPUTS OR SYMPTOMS PROVIDED.

THEY ARE STILL WORK TO BE DONE THOUGH... 

YOU CAN FORK MDS, PULL A REQUEST AND CHECK OUT THE CODES FOR BUGS COZ I KNOW THEY ARE LOTS OF THEM THERE.
